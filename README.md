# 🛋 RxCouch
Subscribe to documents in CouchDB easily. Don't worry about the change feed API. Just make dope real-time UI's. Powered by [RxHttp](https://github.com/mkeen/rxhttp), which I wrote specifically with real-time strongly-typed json feeds in mind. It's ReactiveX all the way down, folks.

### Features

📡 **Automatic Change Notification**  
   RxCouch keeps track of all documents that you are currently subscribed to.  
   It is always subscribed to CouchDB's _`changes` and utilizes the `_doc_ids`  
   filter to ensure you only get the changes you have asked for. A document is  
   a `BehaviorSubject`. RxCouch is real-time by default.
   
😎 **Automatic Document Fetching**  
   If you subscribe to a document id that RxCouch hasn't seen yet, it will  
   be  automatically and transparently fetched, before being injected into a  
   `BehaviorSubject` and returned. The `BehaviorSubject` will, of course, be  
   automatically updated in real-time via the `_changes` feed.  
   
💾 **Automatic Document Creation**  
   If you pass in a partial document, without an `_id` field, RxCouch will  
   automatically add it to the database, and return a `BehaviorSubject` that  
   will, in RxCouch tradition, be automatically updated via the `_changes`  
   feed.
   
📝 **Automatic Document Editing**
   If you pass in a complete document that doesn't match a previously received
   version, the new version will be sent to couchdb and saved.

### Usage
`CouchDB` is the class you will interact with most. Specifically, the `doc` function. An instance  
of `CouchDB` provides the `doc` function, which accepts any document that conforms to `CouchDBDocument`,  
`CouchDBPreDocument`, or a Document Id in the form of a `string`. This function will always return a  
`BehaviorSubject` which contains the most up to date version of the resulting document in CouchDB.  
  
All calls to `doc` will result the resulting Document Id being added to the `_changes` watcher. The watcher  
will transparently update all returned `BehaviorSubject`s in real time when the documents they represent  
are modified in the database. This is the main feature of RxCouch.

Complete documentation coming soon. The below examples should be sufficient to get started, and the code  
is super readable if you need to dive in further.

### Examples

```
import { CouchDB } from '@mkeen/rxcouch';

interface Person implements CouchDBDocument {
  name: String;
  email: String;
}

// Connect to a CouchDB Database
this.couch = new CouchDB('127.0.0.1', 5984, 'items');

// Get the latest version of a known document.
this.couch.doc('4b75030702ae88064daf8182ca00364e')   // Pass in a document id of a known document,
  .subscribe((document: Person) => {                 // and it will be fetched, returned and
    // It's a free country                           // subscribed to.
  }

);

// Create, store, and subscribe to a new person...
const new_person: Person = {
  name: 'Chelsei',
  email: 'c.san@bytewave.co'
}

this.couch.doc(new_person)             // Pass in a document without an _id field and a new
  .subscribe((document: Person) => {   // document will be automatically created in CouchDB.
    // It's a free country             // The new document will be added to the _changes
  })                                   // detection subscription, a BehaviorSubject will
                                       // be returned. This BehaviorSubject will be
                                       // automatically returned in real time. :)
```
